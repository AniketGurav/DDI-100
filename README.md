# DDI-100 dataset
In order to facilitate a new document recognition research, we introduce a Distorted Document Images dataset (DDI-100).<br>
To create the dataset we collected 6658 unique document pages, and extended it by applying different types of distortions and geometric transformations.<br>
In total, DDI-100 contains 99870 document images together with text masks, stamp masks, text and character locations in terms of bounding boxes.

In [scripts directory](https://github.com/machine-intelligence-laboratory/DDI-100/tree/master/scripts) you can find some python scripts with usefull functions and classes for working with dataset.

# DDI-100 dataset
In order to facilitate a new document recognition research, we introduce a Distorted Document Images dataset (DDI-100).<br>
To create the dataset we collected 7000 unique document pages, and extend it by applying different types of distortions and geometric transformations.<br>
In total, DDI-100 contains more than 100,000 document images together with binary text masks, text and character locations in terms of bounding boxes.
